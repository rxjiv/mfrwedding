        <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
        <p class="story-text">
            During a global pandemic when masks were in and social distancing was the norm, our love story sparked with a Teams message. It didn’t take long to realize that no amount of quarantine could keep us apart.
            <br><br>
            From dating right away to meeting halfway in Prince Edward County for wine, sunsets, and responsible masking of course, we packed more milestones into eight months than some do in a lifetime. Engagement? Check. Courthouse wedding? Check. Moving to a whole new country together? Double check. Since then, we’ve been building a laughter-filled, slightly chaotic, and incredibly happy life together.
            <br><br>
            For years, it’s been an ongoing joke that our wedding was happening “next year”. Well, the wait is officially over! We’re beyond thrilled to celebrate our Hindu wedding and five-year anniversary with all of you in April 2026 in Mexico.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for being part of our love story—we can’t wait to eat, dance, and create unforgettable memories together!
            <br><br>
            <strong>With Luv, Jutu xoxo</strong>
